# About this repo
YComplain is a platform for everyone to air their complains.

This repo contains the SDK for APIs at ycomplain.com.

You may integrate this SDK into your site or app in future.


# How to contribute
1. Sign up for an account on YComplain.com. You will get a `session_key` in the your local storage, which will be used in your headers request for making authenticated calls.
2. As you make API calls on the YComplain site, you will notice API calls to https://api.ycomplain.com.
3. Clone this site, if you haven't.
3. Document these APIs in `swagger.yml`. To do this, first, copy the contents of `swagger.yml` to `https://editor.swagger.io`. Update the editor values accordingly. The goal is not to have any errors in the editor UI. Then copy these values back to `swagger.yml` and submit a pull request.
